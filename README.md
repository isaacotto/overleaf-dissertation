# WT: On the Use and Function of Open Notations

*This directory is now directly synchronized with Overleaf.*

## Isaac Otto Hayes --- Fall/Winter 2023

*This is a continuously-updated version of my dissertation mostly serving as a backup in case something weird happens with Overleaf but also as a means of trying things out locally.*

## To-do list:

- Begin with Ch. 1 edits.
    - See if there's anywhere I need to change section breaks.
    - Address large-scale changes suggested by Amy and Michael
        - Issues with discussion of figured-bass
        - Issues with discussion of George  Lewis' paper.
    - Address smaller comments in re: grammar and punctuation.
- Refine abstract as necessary.
- Come up with a better title.
